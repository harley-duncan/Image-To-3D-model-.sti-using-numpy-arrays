This transforms a flat 2D image into 3D by constructing the image using raised patterns of triangles which are a numpy array. It's great if you want to maybe
3D print your photos in a different way. Surprise some guests ey!

Otherwise, if you want a complete mind-blowing 3D model, maybe from a picture of your face, check out https://avatarsdk.com. They are really impressive. I'm definitely gonna work on a simple similar project soon.
